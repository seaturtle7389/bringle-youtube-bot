# bringle-youtube-bot
A Discord bot used primarily to send notifications when specified YouTube channels go live. Interacts with the YouTube API to fetch video details and stores data in a SQLite databse. Also has basic role assignment functionality. I'd like deployment managed through Docker but it's not there yet...... Lots of code provided from the [official discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide/).
